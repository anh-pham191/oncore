                    <h2>4. How we collect personal information</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>We obtain personal information from various sources. We do this in three main ways:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You provide some of it directly (such as by submitting an enquiry).
                        </li>
                        <li>We record some of it automatically when you use our Services or Websites (including with technologies like cookies).
                        </li>
                        <li>We receive some of it from third parties (like when you have clicked on an ad to reach our website).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We&rsquo;ve described this in more detail below.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>a. Personal information you provide</strong><br /><br>
                        When you use our Services, we collect information from you in a number of ways.  For instance, we ask you to provide your name and email address to submit an enquiry. We also maintain your marketing preferences and the emails and other communications that you send us or otherwise contribute, such as customer support inquiries or posts to our customer message boards or forums. You might also provide us with information in other ways, including by responding to surveys, submitting a form or participating in contests or similar promotions.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes we require you to provide us with information for contractual or legal reasons. For example, we may ask you to select your jurisdiction when you make an enquiry to determine if, and how much, tax we need to collect from you. We’ll normally let you know when information is required, and the consequences of failing to provide it. If you do not provide personal information when requested, you may not be able to use our Services if that information is necessary to provide you with the service or if we are legally required to collect it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>b. Personal information obtained from your use of our Services</strong><br /><br>
                        When you use our Services, we collect information about your activity on and interaction with the Services, such as your IP address(es), your device and browser type, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, what pages on our sites you visit and for how long and identifiers associated with your devices. If you’ve given us permission through your device settings, we may collect your location information in our mobile apps.</p>

                    <p>Some of this information is collected automatically using cookies and similar technologies when you use our Services and our Users’ sites. We let our Users control what cookies and similar technologies are used through their sites (except those we need to use to provide the Services properly, such as for performance or security related reasons). You can read more about our use of cookies in our Cookie Policy section. Some of this information is similarly collected automatically through your browser or from your device.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>c. Personal information obtained from other sources</strong><br /><br>
                        If you use a Third Party Service (such as Google) to register for an Account, the Third Party Service may provide us with your Third Party Service account information on your behalf, such as your name and email address (we don’t store passwords you use to access Third Party Services). Your privacy settings on the Third Party Service normally control what they share with us. Make sure you are comfortable with what they share by reviewing their privacy policies and, if necessary, modifying your privacy settings directly on the Third Party Service.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you sign up for Paid Services, we obtain limited information about your payment information.

                    <br>
                    <p>We share personal information in the following ways:
                    </p>

                    <p>Affiliates. We share personal information with our affiliates when it is reasonably necessary or desirable, such as to help provide services to you or analyze and improve the services we or they provide.
                    </p>

                    <p>Business partners.  We may share personal information with business partners. For example, we may share your personal information when our Services are integrated with their Third Party Services, but only when you have been informed or would otherwise expect such sharing.
                    </p>

                    <p>Service providers. We share personal information with our service providers that perform services on our behalf.

                    </p>

                    <p>Following the law or protecting rights and interests.

                    </p>

                    <p>Advertising. We share personal information with third parties so they and we can provide you with tailored advertising and measure and monitor its effectiveness. For example, we may share your pseudonymized email address with a third party social media platform on which we advertise to avoid serving Oncore ads to people who already use Oncore.
                    </p>

                    <p>Business transfers. If we're involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition or sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that deal.
                    </p>

Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to an agreement or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria. For example, the period we keep your email address is connected to how long your Account is active.
                    </p>

                    <p>As Renovators tend to be repeat customers and come back to us after an Account becomes inactive, we don’t immediately delete your personal information when your project is complete. Instead, we keep your personal information for a reasonable period of time, so it will be there for you if you come back.
                    </p>

                    <p>You may delete your Account by contacting us at info@oncoreservices.co.nz and Oncore will delete the personal information it holds about you (unless we need to retain it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy).
                    </p>

                    <p>Please note that in the course of providing the Services, we collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or de-personalized information which we may retain indefinitely.
                    </p>

                    <h2>10. Data transfers</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Personal information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you live, such as, for example, to our servers in New Zealand. We also store personal information locally on the devices you use to access the Services.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your personal information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.
                    </p>

                    <p>We rely upon a number of means to transfer personal information which is subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR.  These include:
                    </p>

                    <p>Privacy. We transfer, in accordance with Article 45 of the GDPR, personal information to companies that have certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S.
                    </p>

                    <p>Standard data protection clauses. We may, in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that have entered into the European Commission approved contract for the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area.
                    </p>

                    <p>Other means. We may, in accordance with Articles 45 and 46 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that are in a country the European Commission or a European data protection supervisory authority has confirmed, by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection, pursuant to an approved certification mechanism or code of conduct, together with binding enforcement commitments from the recipient to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects’ rights, or to processors which have committed to comply with binding corporate rules.
                    </p>

                    <p>You can find out more information about these transfer mechanisms here.

                    <p>We’ll update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, law, our business operations or any other reason we determine is necessary or appropriate. When we make changes, we’ll update the “Effective Date” at the top of the Privacy Policy and post it on our sites. If we make material changes to it or the ways we process personal information, we’ll notify you (by, for example, prominently posting a notice of the changes on our sites before they take effect or directly sending you a notification).
                    </p>

                    <p>We encourage you to check back periodically to review this Privacy Policy for any changes since your last visit.  This will help ensure you better understand your relationship with us, including the ways we process your personal information.
